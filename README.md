# UROC Project: Raspberry Pi cluster for Data Science and Machine Learning

## Supervisor: Gregor von Laszewski, Ph.D. https://laszewski.github.io/, gvonlasz@iu.edu, laszewski@gmail.com

Supervisor Qualifications: 
  Dr. Von Laszewskir has a track record supporting undergraduates at any in organizations he taught. Examples for past successes include an IU award for the best undergraduate project, a Novell developers award, an RIT award for an outstanding undergraduate student research project, the Department of Energy outstanding mentor award, and IU staff award.

Research: In this project, we will be exploring the use of Raspberry Pis for Data Science. Each student will have a minimum of five Raspberry PIs to build a research cluster. The students will explore setting up a Kubernetes, Hadoop, Spark, Kubernetes, or compute services using REST in a reproducible fashion. An application can be chosen based on the students' interest in data science. Examples of applications would be the image detection of features recorded on an autonomous robot boat or the analysis of COVID-19 time series data. If successful, the students can build a cluster with more than 100 Raspberry Pi's at a Lab and test their application on it for benchmarking comparisons.

Deliverables: 

a) Successful creation of a raspberry pi cluster with the newest software for the PI
b) Documentation of the setup in a manual so others can replicate the setup
c) Academic Paper describing the project based on the interest and focus of the student
d) Weekly updates
e) Having fun while doing research

4) We have more information, but this gets you started
5) you can immediately engage with Gregor at <laszewski@gmail.com>

Prerequisites:

1) Knowledge of Python is required. We will use elementary Python, including variables, conditions, loops, functions, classes, modules. 

2) Elementary Knowledge in Linux command line is highly recommended. You will need to know how to manage directories, create files, edit them. Typically this can be learned in less than a day. If you do not know it, you will be obtaining it as part of the research project.

Equipment: 
This project will follow the IU regulations on COVID-19 social distancing for Labs. Furthermore, The student will be given a minimum of five Raspberry Pis, one or more network hubs, cables, SD-cards so the project can be performed at the student's residence.
